I tried the 5 pound as i saw it had more servings and seemed to be worth it. When the new jug arrived today i was surprised the 5 lb one is smaller than the 4lb and had more protein in it. (?) The weight is more obviously and they do this by misleading you with the scoop and serving size ratio. See pictures above for each. The 5 lb scoop is smaller and does not even fill up the older 4 lb scoop as you can see. They have the same amount of protein or less in a smaller jug that is filled more, with a smaller scoop. Thus, you think you are getting more when you buy a 5lb jug but in reality you are not whatsoever. One of the slimiest things ive seen a company do."

The protein amounts and other stuff isn't that great for how much powder is in a serving, but you're taking this to gain weight and muscle mass. So it's only for a few months.

It is pretty sweet so that I don't need to add anything additional to my recipes. For waffles/pancakes, I mix it with a serving of protein pancake mix (i.e. flapjacked, kodiak cakes, etc.). I honestly think the mixture of kodiak cakes and a scoop of the cinnamon bun casein tastes better than the pancake mix alone!"

That being said, I still think this is a great product, and the way I brought up the chocolate flavor (and balanced out the over-sweetness) was to add 1-2 Tablespoons of Hershey's Dark Cocoa Powder into my shaker cup. It all blends up fairly well, makes it extra creamy, and brings a more yummy balance of chocolate and peanut butter. Hope this helps someone! :-)"

For my body, I seem to be the most receptive to Whey Isolate protein shakes which allow me to mentally and physically recover after a tough workout (think - Les Mill BodyCombat, Barry's Bootcamp). Without the powder, my body fatigues about 2 hours after the workout and I just feel like taking a nap. From what i've used, I want to compare the Dymatize All 9 amino acid powder to the REAAL amino acid powder. In terms of taste, the REAAL powder tastes a little better. The Dymatize is a bit too sweet and I recommend mixing it with 16 oz of water (jar recommends 10-12 oz.). In terms of effectiveness, I feel a bit more energized with the REAAL protein powder over the Dymatize one. The Dymatize is still effective but just isn't as much as REAAL. But on a separate note, the Dymatize Isolate works very well and is one of my favorites. If you're not concerned with calories (Amino Acid powder has about 30 per serving), I would stick to a protein shake (generally around 150 per serving)."

It has several beneficial ingredients that are geared toward athletes and performance but can be beneficial to anyone just as a vitamin would be.

The amino acids are helpful to get in one serving of the drink rather than trying to get them from eating foods necessarily, especially if you are a vegan and might not be eating the meat to provide protein, etc. Plus this is easy to drink on the go."

If you use casein you know it's generally thicker than whey with a different flavor profile. This protein mixes extremely well and doesn't clump up anywhere near as much as other casein proteins I've used. But what I really like about it is the taste. It's now my favorite tasting protein by far. Highly recommend it. Tastes better and mixes better than Optimum Nutrition in my opinion."
